# Project Description

Bidirectional Packet Protocol for FPGA(Field Programmable Logic Array) communication is extending the I/Os of Xilinx ZYNQ by adding two Lattice MachXO2 FPGAs each has various bus protocols (I2C, SPI, GPIO ...). The Xilinx ZYNQ acts as routing fabrics that are connected to the MachXO2 FPGAs with a single LVDS pair and share a common clock with the ZYNQ. In addition to optimizing the communication with encoding and SERDES.
